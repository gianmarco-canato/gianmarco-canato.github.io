                <summary><h2>↘ Liminal Duo</h2></summary>                
                <p>
                    Liminal Duo was founded in 2021 by Gianmarco Canato (bassoon) and <a href="http://mattiaolgiati.github.io">↘Mattia Olgiati (Electronics)</a> with the intention of merging their personal musical languages and exploring the interaction between the acoustical instrument and the vast sonic possibilities of the electronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sound of the bassoon is captured, processed and transfigured to the end of expanding its expressive capabilites, crossing its physical limits, incontrovertibly creating an unforeseeable stimulating mix of languages, one which reinterprets typical styles of the traditional repertoire. The collaboration between the two musicians is not limited to performance only, but expanding the repertoire with original works is among their goals, along with collaborations with other artists and musical improvisation.

                <summary><h2>↘ Un programma quasi francese</h2></summary>
                <p>
                    Literally an almost entirely french program, this project is done in collaboration with pianist Franesca Rivabene. The projects explores the musical aesthetic of late 19th and early 20th century in central Europe, where impressionism was widespread and expressionism started to arise while musically there was a mixture of complete novelty, neo-classicism and neo-romanticism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program features pieces by both French composers Maurice Ravel, Charles Koechlin and Camille Saint-Saëns and artists that were somehow related — either stylistically or via direct influenced — to the Frenc environment: Paul Hindemith, Anton Glière, Alexandre Tansman.

                <summary><h2>↘ Impressioni Sfuggenti</h2></summary>
                <p>
                    “Impressioni sfuggenti” offers musical pieces inspired to impressions, consonances and memories that are transfigured by the creative mind of the composers. The project involves violist Pietro Montemagni and Mattia Olgiati as a guest composer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program features <i>Au Quai</i>, a strongly narrative piece by Elliot Carter that evokes a short story by Arnold Schoenberg in which the inhabitants of a small fisherman village, after their sailors were absent for a number of days at sea, rush to the wharf shouting “au quai!” Another featured composer is Philippe Hersant: in both his pieces for bassoon and viola he reinterprets memories of ancentral sonorities in a contemporary setting with extended techniques and multiphonics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>L’Invisibile proferito</i> by Mattia Olgiati proposes two lines of dialogue that share an unique narrative, a whispered message that shouts and cuts the silence, placing itself at the extremes of our acoustic sensitivity. <i>3 diapositive</i>, on the other hand, explores the relationship between a shared musical memory and its possible divergent intepretations.
